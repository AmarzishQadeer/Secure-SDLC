S-SDLC (Secure System Development Life Cycle) emphasize integrating security into software development processes. S-SDLC is an approach to integrating security practices into each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its goal is to ensure that security is considered at every step of the development process rather than being an afterthought. By embedding security into the development lifecycle, organizations can reduce vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and improve overall software quality.

DevSecOps is a cultural and engineering practice that integrates security into the DevOps process. DevSecOps aims to make security a shared responsibility across all teams involved in the software development lifecycle.

S-SDLC and DevSecOps are both focused on embedding security into the development lifecycle, but they differ in their approach and scope:

<ul>
<li> S-SDLC integrates security into each SDLC phase in a structured, often linear manner. </li>
<li> DevSecOps emphasizes continuous security integration in agile, iterative development  </li>
<li> S-SDLC provides the blueprint for secure software development. </li>
<li> DevSecOps operationalizes this blueprint in dynamic, automated, and collaborative environments.
<li> DevSecOps extends the principles of S-SDLC by introducing automation (e.g., automated testing tools) and fostering collaboration between development, security, and operations teams.cycles. </li>
<li> DevSecOps often operationalizes S-SDLC principles using modern DevOps tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, SonarQube) to ensure security checks are embedded in CI/CD pipelines. </li>
  
</ul>
